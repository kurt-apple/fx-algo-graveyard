Here lay many quick 'n dirty forex automated trading programs, indicators, scripts, and scanners; and more to come.  
Quick info about this repository:
- When I mean quick 'n dirty I mean it. Most isn't commented well or "properly." If I do update this repo I'll fix that
- I never intended to share any of these, so the code is in the format that I like (which you might not, and I understand)
- MQL (*.mq4) is a proprietary C99 flavor. It's actually quite charming.
- None of this code made it into real money, and I highly recommend you do not go live with any of these bots.   

Why?
- Fun!
- There will always be a soft spot in my heart for old C.
- Research.   

The ability to program and immediately backtest in MetaTrader is great.

To-Do/Wishlist:
- Upgrade to one of my broker's APIs
- GPGPU backtesting
- Smarter bots
- Higher-quality data sources

Enjoy!
